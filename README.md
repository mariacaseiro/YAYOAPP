# YAYOAPP
Mobile app for the elderly people. Done in 36 hours for the UDC Hackton

# HOW TO SETUP

To run the aplication, you need two API Keys: one for OpenWeatherAPI and another for OpenAI (this keys are used to create weather forecasts):
+ **OpenWeatherAPI**: You can get a free key [here](https://openweathermap.org/price)
+ **OpenAI**: You need an OpenAI account to create a key. In March 2023, you need to use a paid account to use this API (but for experimental uses, the costs are really cheap, about 20 cents were spent to develop this app). You can get more information [here](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api).

Once you have the necessary keys, you must enter them in the file **apikeys.properties**.
